# Design Decisions

Merki embraces a minimalist philosophy where form follows function. The interactive workspace demo replaces static mockups, allowing users to experience the product immediately—tasks persist via localStorage, creating genuine engagement. Subtle animations (hover effects, slide-ins, scale transforms) provide delightful micro-interactions without overwhelming users. The color-coded tag system (Design, Sales, Marketing) enables quick visual scanning. Dark mode respects system preferences, ensuring comfortable viewing across contexts. Keyboard shortcuts (Ctrl+K) prioritize power users while maintaining discoverability. All transitions use 200-300ms durations for perceived responsiveness. The design balances aesthetic elegance with functional clarity, proving productivity tools need not sacrifice beauty for utility.
